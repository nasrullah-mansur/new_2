                        Bail is a way the courts ensure that a person who has been arrested and charged with a crime can be safely released from jail prior to resolution of their case. Those who lack the means to post bail or does
                        not post bond with a bail bondsman will stay in jail until their court date, sometimes for weeks or months. They can lose their job, home or child's custody while in jail. Anyone can apply online for
                        emergency cash advance bail loan and pay the full cash bond or have an affordable bail bondsman or bail agent post bond for their loved one release with the court clerkâ€™s office or the local jail.
